            <p class="mainContent">In December 2002, <a href="mailto:pastor@nbministries.net">Elder Martin Johnson</a> accepted the call of God to pastor. God began to give Pastor Johnson the vision for New Beginning's Ministries of Peoria. A ministry that would call the people of God to the next level. As Pastor Johnson began to seek God for guidance, God gave him the name "New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria", a ministry designed "to equip and empower the people of God in winning the world to Christ". After several prospective locations, God led Pastor & <a href="mailto:lisa.johnson@nbministries.net">First Lady Lisa</a> and the New Beginnings family to 8900 N. Industrial Road. The people of God pulled together using their God given gifts to transform this place into a place of worship and on February 9, 2003 New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria opened its doors to walk into God's divine will.</p>	 
	 
	 <p class="mainContent">Pastor Johnson began to fulfill the vision of the ministry through the holistic teaching of the Word of God to a handful of believers. As God graced the ministry, the family of New Beginning's Ministries of Peoria was birthed and began to grow. The spirit of the Lord showed up and showed out in the house each service breaking yokes and setting souls free. Many souls were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>

	 In February 2006, God called Pastor Johnson and the family of New Beginnings to the next level in ministry. New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria moved by faith to Carver Community Center, while the Lord was preparing our new place of worship at 1917 Wisconsin. The family of New Beginnings Ministries without reservation brought the spirit and presence of the Lord into the Carver Community Center each and every service. God manifested his glory by transforming and renewing many lives through the services at the Community Center. In June 2006, Pastor Johnson announced the joyous news of moving in to our new home on July 9, 2006. The family of New Beginnings came together once again to prepare the house of God for worship. After many long hours of labor and prayer, the family of New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria marched into the doors of 1917 Wisconsin "shouting for joy in victory and putting the devil under our feet". God has led the family of New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria to make a difference in the lives of the community it serves and an impact for the Body of Christ.	 </p>
