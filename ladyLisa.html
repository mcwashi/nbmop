           Elder Lisa Johnson (affectionately called Lady Lisa) is the wife of Elder Martin Johnson, Pastor and founder of New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria. <br /><br /> 
She began her public ministry in January 2002 and began teaching and preaching the Word of God whenever called upon.  She is an ordained minister of the gospel under the eadership of her husband, and is devoted to New Beginnings Ministries of Peoria.  She diligently assists her husband with a variety of duties to assure that his god-given mandate is carried out. She has the same emphasis in ministering as her husband and pastor, which are praise, faith and family.<br /><br /> 
Known for her 'down-to-earth' personality and love of laughter, Lady Lisa allows those qualities to guide her into the unique ministry that god has called her toâ€¦"being herself in God"!  She enjoys imparting to others truths from the word of god that helps them to understand their position in Christ. </p></span></div>

Elder Lisa Johnson currently works as a computer programmer and is in the process of completing her b.a. in Business Management with an emphasis in religious studies from Liberty University. She is an alumnus of Illinois Central College and has a Ministerial degree from Aenon Bible College.<br /><br /> 
However, Lady Lisa continues to believe that her first call is to her husband and children and purposes to balance her time in ministry without jeopardizing the relationships that god has entrusted to her care.  An avid "soccer mom" she spends much of her free time enjoying time with her children and encouraging them to be all that god has destined them to be.  Pastor and Lady Johnson have three children who all serve faithfully in various aspects of the youth ministry.
